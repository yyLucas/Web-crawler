Please feel free to contact me at zhangysd@hotmail.com


I have implemented the following functions:

(1) Web crawler
(2) Lucene search engine
(3) Spring mvc framework for crawl and search
(4) Jsoup client and parser


Instruction:

(1) Run either from SpiderController.java or AdvanceController under webCrawler.controller package.
	SpiderController is using http client and parser.
	AdvanceController is using Jsoup client and parser.
(2) input "localhost:8080/spider" into the address bar of a browser, 
	and you can specify the URL and depth to crawl. Hit crawl button to start crawl
(3) After the crawl is successful, the console will display the message "Crawl successful",
	and the searching page is shown.
(4) Input keyword to search, enjoy the results.
